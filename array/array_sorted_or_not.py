#Problem Statement: Given an array of size n, write a program to check if the given array is sorted in (ascending / Increasing / Non-decreasing) order or not. If the array is sorted then return True, Else return False.



"""
Example 1:
Input: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: True.
Explanation: The given array is sorted i.e Every element in the array is smaller than or equals to its next values, So the answer is True.


Example 2:
Input: N = 5, array[] = {5,4,6,7,8}
Output: False.
Explanation: The given array is Not sorted i.e Every element in the array is not smaller than or equal to its next values, So the answer is False.

Here element 5 is not smaller than or equal to its future elements.
